One more reminder about tea time in a few hours! Let me know if anything comes up.
<% end %>

Can't wait to see you!

P.S. If you need to cancel, it's super easy. Just [go to your account on the site](http://teawithstrangers.com/profile?utm_campaign=reminder&utm_medium=email&utm_content=cancel) and hit the 'Cancel' button. This way, your spot can be opened up for someone else.
