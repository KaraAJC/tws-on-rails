A spot just opened up on the tea time that you were waiting on! I hope you can make it!

<%= render partial: "shared_mailers/info_nohost", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

[Grab it quick before it's gone!](<%= profile_url %>)

<%= @tea_time.host.name %>

P.S. In case you forgot your password, [you can reset it easily here](http://www.teawithstrangers.com/users/password/new?utm_campaign=waitlistfree&utm_medium=email&utm_content=changepw).
