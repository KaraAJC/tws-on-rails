Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!
 
Ankit here, the creator of Tea With Strangers.  

We're building a little community of strangers who are into making our world a little bit smaller. In the big picture, we want to make our neighborhoods more neighborly, our friends more friendly, communities more communal, humans more human. Thanks for being a part of that.  

We aren't fully set up to get things moving in <%= @user.home_city.name %>, but we'll be there soon! If you'd like to help speed things along, these are two things we need more than any:

1. Great hosts. If you or someone you know would make a great one, [check this out](http://teawithstrangers.com/hosting?utm_campaign=registrationupcoming&utm_medium=email&utm_content=hosting) and hit us up.
2. Great people like yourself to join for tea time! So share TWS with your pals on facebook and twitter :)

And while you're on facebook, show us some love and 'Like' our page. You know how social media affirmation works: <http://facebook.com/teawithstrangers>. 

Super love,  
Ankit

P.S. Since you signed up, you'll need to log in to register for tea times when we reach you. For now, your password is <%= @password %> (but you should [change it here](<%= url_for(controller: 'registrations', action: 'edit', only_path: false, utm_campaign: 'registrationupcoming', utm_medium: 'email', utm_content: 'changepw') %>)).
<% end %>  

P.P.S. If you want to learn more about what this is about, talk about how to get involved, exchange digital high fives, whatever, you can (and absolutely should) reply to this note.
