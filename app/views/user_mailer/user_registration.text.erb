Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!
 
Ankit here, one of the hosts behind Tea With Strangers. 

First off, you're awesome for signing up. It says a lot that you're cool with the idea of sharing stories and having a conversation with strangers.

If you haven't yet, you should absolutely find a time to sit for tea here: <%=
url_for(controller: 'cities',
        action: 'schedule',
        id: @user.home_city.city_code,
        only_path: false) %>.

<% if @password %>
Now, tea time is really cool. So cool that you might want to sign up for another one after your first. To do that, log in with <%= @user.email %> and this password — <%= @password %> — but change it to something easier to remember here: <%= url_for(controller: 'registrations', action: 'edit', only_path: false) %>.
<% end %>

Super love,
Ankit

P.S. Show us some love on Facebook (http://facebook.com/teawithstrangers) where we'll share some awesome stories about what happens at tea time. 

Oh, and tell your friends about us. Soon enough, strangers will be sitting together for the greatest conversations of all time, 7 days a week, in big cities worldwide.
