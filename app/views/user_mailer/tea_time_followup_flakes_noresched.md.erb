Hey hey,

The tea time you had to cancel on actually just happened. In case you didn't get a chance to after you had to cancel, I just wanted to make sure you got a chance to reschedule for another tea time. [Here's the schedule!](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities',action: 'schedule',id: @user.home_city.city_code,only_path: false) %>) Pick a time that works for you, yeah?

Hope to catch you at a tea time soon!!
