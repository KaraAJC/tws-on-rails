Hey <%= @user.name %>,

Just a note to confirm that you won't be joining for the following tea time:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

It'd be awesome if you were able to find another time that does work for you, so be sure to check out the schedule here: <%=
url_for(controller: 'cities',
        action: 'schedule',
        id: @user.home_city.city_code,
        only_path: false) %>.

In case you forgot your password, you can reset it with ease here: http://www.teawithstrangers.com/users/password/new.

Hope your day is going beautifully. If not, grab a bar of chocolate and watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-gQLqv9f4o. 

Happy days!
