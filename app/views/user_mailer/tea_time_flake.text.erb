Hey <%= @user.name %>,

Just a note to confirm that you won't be joining for the following tea time:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

It'd be awesome if you were able to find another time that does work for you, so
be sure to check out the schedule here: 
<%= url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'index', only_path: false) %>.

Hope your day is going beautifully. If not, grab a bar of chocolate and watch

Happy days!
