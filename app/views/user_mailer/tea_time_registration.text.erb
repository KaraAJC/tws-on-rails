Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!

Just confirming the tea time you just signed up for! Attached to this email is a calendar event so that you don't forget. If you hit the 'Add to Calendar' button, it'll be on your cal.

For good measure (in case you really hate calendars for some reason), tea time deets are:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

Can't wait to have you for tea!

Happy days,
The Tea With Strangers team

If you don't remember your password, there's a good chance it's the same one you received in the first email we sent you. You should be able to find it easily by searching 'high fives from tea with strangers' in your inbox. If you can't, reply to this and we'll sort you out :).
