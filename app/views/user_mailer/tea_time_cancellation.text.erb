Hey <%= @user.name %>,
 
We're really sorry for this, but your upcoming tea time was canceled.

<!-- It'd be good to include the details for relevant tea time here -->

We try to make sure this rarely happens, so emails like this are only sent when there's a good reason for it.

In the meantime, we'd love it if there were another time that did work for you. Check out the schedule here: <%= url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'index', only_path: false) %>.

Hope you're having a super duper day! If not, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaIvk1cSyG8.

Thumbs up for rock and roll!
