Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!
 
Ankit here, one of the hosts behind Tea With Strangers. 

Just wanted to thank you for signing up. The world is better when we take a second to understand each other, and that's what we're going after with tea time. Thanks for being a part of it.

Tea time is happening pretty regularly in <%= @user.home_city.name %>. If you haven't yet, find a time to sit for tea here: <<%=url_for(controller: 'cities',action: 'schedule',id: @user.home_city.city_code, only_path: false) %>>.

And if you're on facebook, show us some love and 'Like' our page. You know how social media affirmation works: <http://facebook.com/teawithstrangers>. 

Super love,  
Ankit

P.S. You'll need to be logged in to pick a tea time. For now, your password is <%= @password %> (but you should [change it here](<%= url_for(controller: 'registrations', action: 'edit', only_path: false) %>)).
<% end %>  

P.P.S. If you want to [host tea time where you are](http://teawithstrangers.com/hosting), learn more about what this is about, talk about how to get involved, exchange digital high fives, whatever, you can (and absolutely should) reply to this note.
