Hey hey <%= @user.name %>!

Just wanted to shoot you a quick reminder about tea time in two days! Could you reply to this just to confirm that you'll be there?

For a refresher, here are the details:

<%= render partial: "tea_time_info", locals: {tea_time: @tea_time} %>

Super excited to see you!

Cheers,
<%= tea_time.host.name %>

P.S. If you need to cancel last minute, it's super easy. Just log into the site, clicking 'Account' and clicking the 'Cancel' button. This way, your spot can be opened up for someone else.
