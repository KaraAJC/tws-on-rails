		Hosts are the backbone of Tea With Strangers. With more of them, we can bring more strangers together, but we pay careful attention to ensure that all of our hosts fit the bill of what we’re trying to create together.

		If you love bringing people together, asking questions, being yourself, trying to figure out what ‘being yourself’ even means, welcoming others without inhibition, and generally making our world smaller and more awesome, you might be host material.
