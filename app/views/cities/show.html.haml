          Tea time is a two hour conversation fueled by the stories, questions, and listening of a few strangers and a super host.

          It gets awkward and we'll talk about the weather or some TV show.

          All sorts of serendipity!
        %li

        %li
          Maybe we become friends. Maybe not. That's cool too.
