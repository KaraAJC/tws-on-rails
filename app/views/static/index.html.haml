        Tea time is a two hour conversation fueled by the stories, questions, and listening of a few strangers and a super host.

        You should sign up and come sometime. Yes, you.

        Something funny happens when strangers sit together for two hours.
      %p.big
        We don't really have a specific reason to talk, so this could be awkward. We probably don't have connections through work, mutual friends, or any particular common interests.
      %p.big
        But we aren't actually that different. We're all proud, insecure, believers of something or another, passionate about things that matter to us, and we have loved ones â€” and when we sit, listen, and share thoughts and stories, we start seeing that.
      %p.big
        But goodness, we won't see it by reading a website about strangers, and we definitely won't see it by connecting on Instatweetbook.
