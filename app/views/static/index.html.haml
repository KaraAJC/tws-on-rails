      Let's get tea.

        Tea time is a two hour conversation fueled by a few strangers, a super
        host, good questions, stories, and lots of listening.

        You should come sometime. Or fivetimes.

        Something funny happens when strangers sit together for two hours.
      %p.big
        We don't really have a specific reason to talk, so this could be awkward. We probably don't have connections through work, mutual friends, or any particular common interests.
      %p.big
        But we aren't actually that different. We're all proud, insecure, believers of something or another, passionate about things that matter to us, and we have loved ones â€” and when we sit, listen, and share thoughts and stories, we start seeing that.
      %p.big
        But goodness, we won't see it by reading a website about strangers, and we definitely won't see it by connecting on Instatweetbook.
