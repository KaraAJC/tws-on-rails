        Tea time is a two hour conversation fueled by the stories, questions, and listening of a few strangers and a super host.
      %p.big
        You should sign up and come sometime. 
        %a{href: '#footer'} Yes, you.

      %h3.divider
        We're strangers, but we're not that strange.
      %p.big
        We all have good days and bad days. We're all scared of something, have loved ones, pet peeves, insecurities, points of pride, and passions that matter to us.
      %p.big
        The funny thing is that without common friends, interests, or fields of work, we probably won't cross paths. So it's hard to see how similar we actually are in our day-to-day (even if we're following each other on Instatweetbook.)
      %p.big
        But we might just start to see it if we sit for a conversation. It's a better shot than reading a website about strangers, at the least. Let's get tea.

        So let's get tea!

        We bring tea time to cities where we know the locals want great conversations and we can ensure amazing hosts. The hosts we have already are bomb. Get to know 'em below!
      %ul.cities.multiple-hosts
        - @cities_by_host[:many_hosts].each do |c|
          = render partial: 'shared/city_hosts_item', locals: {city: c}
      %ul.cities.single-host
        - @cities_by_host[:single_host].each do |c|
          = render partial: 'shared/city_hosts_item', locals: {city: c}
  .upcoming.cities.row
    .wide
      %h3.divider.with-sub
        We're on our way here.
      %h4.divider-sub
        These are our next few destinations. If any of the below is home for you, check out the page and sign up! The more people we know will come, the faster we'll bring tea time there.
      %ul.cities.no-host
        //No host cities (where we'll be soon)
        - @cities_by_host[:no_hosts].each do |c|
          = render partial: 'shared/city_hosts_item', locals: {city: c}
      %h4.divider-sub.top-margin
        If home is some place else for you and you think you'd lead the charge in bringing tea time there,
