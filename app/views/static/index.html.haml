        Tea time is a two hour conversation fueled by the stories, questions, and listening of a few strangers and a super host.

        You should sign up and come sometime. Yes, you.

        We're strangers, but we're not that strange.
      %p.big
        We all have good days and bad days. We are scared of something, have loved ones, pet peeves, insecurities, points of pride, and passions that matter to us.

        The funny thing is that without common friends, interests, or fields of work, it's unlikely we cross paths. So it's hard to actually see those commonalities in our day-to-day (even if we're following each other on Instatweetbook.)
      %p.big
        But if we stop searching for perspective on a website and instead sit for a conversation, we'll see it. So let's get tea.
