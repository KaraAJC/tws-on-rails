          Thousands of us are here for a summer. Between hackathons and picnics, let's sit for a conversation.

            %strong The Intern Project and Tea With Strangers are working to make tea time happen for interns in the Bay Area this summer.
          %p
            We follow each other on twitter. We like each other's projects on
            %a{href:"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1378139645766413/"} the facebook group.
            Maybe we even hack together or see each other at work. But let's take a second to share stories and understand each other at tea time.
        .do-it
          %h3 So here's what we gotta do:
          %ul
            %li
              %h4
                Join for tea time
              %p
                Tea time is a conversation fueled by the stories, questions, and listening of a few strangers and a super host.
              = render partial: 'shared/signup', locals: {dropdown: true}
            %li
              %h4
                Apply to be a host
              %p
                A good host is cool with asking questions, is pretty generous, and can make decisions on the fly. They have massive hearts and reflect plentifully (even if their reflections don't turn into blog posts).

            Until July 4th or so, tea times will be available to interns the same way it is to everyone else in SF (i.e. interns and non-interns alike at tea time.) In that time, we'll be getting some interns ready to become hosts themselves, and from early July, we'll be having regular intern-only tea times for the rest of the summer.
      / %p.subheader
      /   In the last few months, thousands in SF have already sat for tea, but with all of you flowing into the Bay Area this summer, we knew that there needed to be better, more regular ways to connect meaningfully. That's why The Intern Project and Tea With Strangers are working together to make tea time happen for you guys specifically.

  /           Hosts pull tea time together and make sure the conversations run a little bit deeper than the weather. They ask good questions. They have massive hearts, reflect plentifully (even if their reflections don't turn into blog posts), smile a lot, and they know how to make an environment warm.
