          Thousands of us are here for a summer. Between hackathons and picnics, let's try to understand each other.

          We follow each other on twitter. We like each other's projects on
          %a{href:"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1378139645766413/"} the facebook group.
          Maybe we even hack together or see each other at work.
