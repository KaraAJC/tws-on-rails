      %h3.divider Hosting tea time
      %p 
        If you walk around your city or campus and make up stories about the people that walk around you, you'd probably make a great host.

        Tea time hosts bring together conversations by asking questions, smiling a whole bunch, and being really good huggers. To make sure tea time is reliable and the conversation is always awesome (and getting better every time), it's usually best when a host can bring tea time together once a week.
