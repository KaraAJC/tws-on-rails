            We're learning how to design an evening for amazing conversations.
          </h3>
          <p>
           We're going to be trying new things while we work to find something that we know will be awesome, every time. (Well, a significant portion of the time. No such thing as perfect.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes, we'll tell you what we're doing. Sometimes, you'll just find out when you get there.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first one on September 9, we'll share this — we've made two batches of cards with questions on them. One batch is playful, trivia prompts. The other has more personal or "deep" prompts. The first hour, we'll hand out all playful cards. The second hour, we'll add in a personal one. You can use them (or not).
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh, and we'll have great tea and appetizers graciously provided by Samovar Tea Lounge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Can't wait to see you there.

          <%= link_to 'Tea With Strangers', root_path %> is all about bringing people together for meaningful and fun interactions. We're mostly known for tea time — a conversation between a few strangers and a super host. You should sign up and join (if you've signed up before, <%= link_to 'log in and find a time here', new_user_session_path %>.)
