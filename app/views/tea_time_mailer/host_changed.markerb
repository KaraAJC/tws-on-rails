Hey <%= @new.name %>,

Just letting you know you're now the host for <%= @old.name %>'s tea time. It's
on [<%= @tt.start_time %> at <%= @tt.location %>](<%= url_for(controller: :tea_times, action: :show, id: @tt, only_path: false) %>).

Please speak with <%= @old.name %> if they didn't discuss this with you! (It's probably a mistake).

Bleep bleep bloop,
