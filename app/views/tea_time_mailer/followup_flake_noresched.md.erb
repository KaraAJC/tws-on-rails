Hey hey,

The tea time you had to cancel on actually just happened. In case you didn't get a chance to after you had to cancel, I just wanted to make sure you got a chance to reschedule for another tea time. [Here's the schedule!](<%=url_for(controller: 'cities', action: 'schedule', id: @tea_time.city.city_code, only_path: false) %>) Pick a time that works for you, yeah?

All good things,
